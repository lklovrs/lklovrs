# Hi, I’m Nurul Syakirin 👋

I’m an IT student passionate about front-end development and building practical applications that solve everyday problems. One of my main projects is an **Wardrobe OOTD (Outfit of the Day) application** that helps users manage their wardrobe and get outfit suggestions based on their clothing items.

## 🔨 Projects
